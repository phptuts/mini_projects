# Welcome to Mini Projects

Welcome to mini projects.  Mini projects are small projects that take anywhere between 5 minutes to an hour to code.  They are designed to get you out of just doing tutorials to practicing coding.  We are going to have mini projects on HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Svelte, and SwiftUI.  We may expand to other areas as well.
