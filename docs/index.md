# Welcome to Mini Projects

Welcome to mini-projects.  Mini projects are small projects that take anywhere between 5 minutes to an hour to code.  They are designed to get you from just doing tutorials to practicing coding.  We will have mini projects on HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Svelte, and SwiftUI.  We may expand to other areas as well.
