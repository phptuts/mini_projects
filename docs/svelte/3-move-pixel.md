# Svelte Mini Challenge - Move Pixel

In this mini-challenge, your goal is to create a svelte application with four buttons, up, down, left, and right. Each time a button is clicked, it should move the pixel div in that button's direction. Go ahead and give this mini-challenge a good try and if you have any problems or feedback, let me know in the comments below. Please let me know if you did the mini-challenge and its solution. I have learned a lot from other people's challenge solutions, and it helps others.
